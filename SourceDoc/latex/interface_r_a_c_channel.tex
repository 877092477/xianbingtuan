\subsection{Detailed Description}
A two-\/way channel.

Conceptually, \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_r_a_c_channel}{R\+A\+C\+Channel}} can be thought of as a bidirectional connection, composed of two controllable signals that work in parallel.

For example, when connecting between a view and a model\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}   Model                      View
\end{DoxyVerb}
 {\ttfamily leading\+Terminal} -\/-\/-\/---$>$ {\ttfamily following\+Terminal} {\ttfamily leading\+Terminal} $<$-\/-\/-\/--- {\ttfamily following\+Terminal}

The initial value of the model and all future changes to it are {\itshape sent on} the {\ttfamily leading\+Terminal}, and {\itshape received by} subscribers of the {\ttfamily following\+Terminal}.

Likewise, whenever the user changes the value of the view, that value is sent on the {\ttfamily following\+Terminal}, and received in the model from the {\ttfamily leading\+Terminal}. However, the initial value of the view is not received from the {\ttfamily leading\+Terminal} (only future changes).

The terminal which \char`\"{}follows\char`\"{} the lead of the other terminal, only sending {\itshape future} values to the subscribers of the {\ttfamily leading\+Terminal}.

The latest value sent to the {\ttfamily leading\+Terminal} (if any) will be sent immediately to new subscribers of this terminal, and then all future values as well. \mbox{\Hypertarget{interface_r_a_c_channel_a945eadc4078674ea25b68fd27a671448}\label{interface_r_a_c_channel_a945eadc4078674ea25b68fd27a671448}}

The terminal which \char`\"{}leads\char`\"{} the channel, by sending its latest value immediately to new subscribers of the {\ttfamily following\+Terminal}.

New subscribers to this terminal will not receive a starting value, but will receive all future values that are sent to the {\ttfamily following\+Terminal}.
