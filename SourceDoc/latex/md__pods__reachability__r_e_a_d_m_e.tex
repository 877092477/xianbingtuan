This is a drop-\/in replacement for Apples \mbox{\hyperlink{interface_reachability}{Reachability}} class. It is A\+RC compatible, uses the new G\+CD methods to notify of network interface changes.

In addition to the standard N\+S\+Notification it supports the use of Blocks for when the network becomes reachable and unreachable.

Finally you can specify wether or not a W\+W\+AN connection is considered \char`\"{}reachable\char`\"{}.

\subsection*{A Simple example}

\begin{DoxyVerb}// allocate a reachability object
Reachability* reach = [Reachability reachabilityWithHostname:@"www.google.com"];

// set the blocks 
reach.reachableBlock = ^(Reachability*reach)
{
    NSLog(@"REACHABLE!");
};

reach.unreachableBlock = ^(Reachability*reach)
{
    NSLog(@"UNREACHABLE!");
};

// start the notifier which will cause the reachability object to retain itself!
[reach startNotifier];\end{DoxyVerb}
